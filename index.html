                <h2>About This Site</h2>
                <p>Our Mission is to enhance the effectiveness of <a href="http://getmonero.org">The Monero Project</a> and its community, by connecting people with the supports and services essential, for efficient learning & researching the project, actively contributing to it or just benefiting the most from, what Monero has to offer.
<br>In such a dynamic working environment like crypto-currencies, knowledge management becomes crucial. To maintain a high performing community, it is important all people have access to the existing knowledge about projects processes. We hope to support Monero by building infrastructure & ressources, that support the efficient management of project knowledge and creates a information-sharing culture in the community. That is creating synergies for development and is avoiding common inefficiencies of Free Software Projects.
